Got NEC USB 2.0 Card working, tested only with an Mouse..

howto:

  1) install cbenable, using PCI IRQ routing
  
  2) copy files and change (with an binary editor) OEMHLP$ to OEMHL2$.
     You should find the files in \os2\boot\
     hcimonit.exe -> hcimonit2.exe
     usbehcd.sys  -> usbehcd2.sys 
     usbohcd.sys  -> usbohcd2.sys 
     usbuhcd.sys  -> usbuhcd2.sys
     
  3) run hcimonit2.exe. 
     Example output:
  
      You have 2 PCI USB OHCI host controller(s)
      You have 1 PCI USB UHCI host controller(s)
      You have 1 PCI USB EHCI host controller(s)
      
     the UHCI is an onboard device, and the 2 OHCI and 1 EHCI
     is from the card.

  4) add more host controller drivers to config.sys
  
      BaseDev=cbenable.sys ....
      BaseDev=oemhlp2.sys
      ....
      BaseDev=USBUHCD.SYS/V
        that lines were already present
        
      BaseDev=USBOHCD2.SYS /V
      BaseDev=USBOHCD2.SYS /V
      BaseDev=USBEHCD2.sys /V
        added lines
      
      BaseDev=USBD.SYS /V
      BaseDev=USBHID.SYS /V
      ...
        that lines were already present      
      
  5) reboot and attach devices. NEVER remove the USB card,
     before compleded shutdown, else the system will likely hang!


Warning:
  - during development a USB card got unusable (EPROM damage?),
    reason unknown.
  - do not remove or disable the card, the USB(U|O|E)HCD.SYS driver
    can not handle the case of an suddenly unavailable controller.
