NAME
       biosdecode - BIOS information decoder

SYNOPSIS
       biosdecode [OPTIONS]


DESCRIPTION
       biosdecode  parses  the  BIOS  memory  and prints information about all
       structures (or entry points) it knows of. Currently known  entry  point
       types are:

       o SMBIOS (System Management BIOS)
         Use dmidecode for a more detailed output.

       o DMI (Desktop Management Interface, a legacy version of SMBIOS)
         Use dmidecode for a more detailed output.

       o SYSID

       o PNP (Plug and Play)

       o ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface)

       o BIOS32 (BIOS32 Service Directory)

       o PIR (PCI IRQ Routing)

       o 32OS (BIOS32 Extension, Compaq-specific)
         See ownership for a Compaq ownership tag retrieval tool.

       o SNY (Sony-specific, not decoded)

       o VPD (Vital Product Data, IBM-specific)
         Use vpddecode for a more detailed output.


       biosdecode  started  its  life as a part of dmidecode but as more entry
       point types were added, if was moved to a different program.


OPTIONS
       -d, --dev-mem FILE
              Read memory from device FILE (default: /dev/mem)

       -h, --help
              Display usage information and exit

       -V, --version
              Display the version and exit


FILES
       /dev/mem

BUGS
       Most of the time, biosdecode prints too  much  information  (you  don't
       really  care  about addresses) or not enough (because it doesn't follow
       pointers and has no lookup tables).
