e_* programs are encoders from 8 bit codepage to unicode/utf8
d_* programs are decoders from unicode/utf8 to 8 bit codepage
*u programs use UniApi dlls (OS/2 only)
*z programs use zst unit, is not as good, simpler and portable

utf8.pas does core encode/decode
utf8u.pas uses utf8 and UniApi for codepage strings
utf8z.pas uses utf8 and zst for codepage strings

850.* and UTF8demo.txt (UTF-8-demo.txt) are sample files
