INT 1E - SYSTEM DATA - DISKETTE PARAMETERS
Notes:  the default parameter table (see #01264) is located at F000h:EFC7h for
          100% compatible BIOSes
        if the table is changed, INT 13/AH=00h should be called to ensure that
          the floppy-disk controller is appropriately reprogrammed
        before rebooting the machine, this pointer should be restored to point
          to the original position of the floppy parameters in the ROM BIOS.
          The DOS boot sector takes care of this and in the case of a bootstrap
          error, resets the vector. It also passes the original pointer to the
          IO.SYS/IBMDOS.COM file for possible later restoration.
        under PhysTechSoft's PTS ROM-DOS this table is fictitious.
        the DR-DOS multi-OS LOADER (at least 1.04 up to including DR-DOS 7.03)
          does not alter the INT 1Eh vector when launching IBMBIO.COM files
          via its boot methods "S" or "D".  Although this allows booting
          (uncompressed) IBMBIO.COM files bigger than 29 KB, it may
          occasionally cause the floppy parameters to get trashed due to a
          bug in the DR-DOS 7.03 IBMBIO.COM startup code.
BUG:    The 2nd level decompressor of the DR-DOS 7.03 IBMBIO.COM (1998/08/11 to
          1999/07) start-up code erroneously assumes that the floppy parameters
          reside at 0000h:7C00h (normally set up there by the boot sector)
          instead of relying on the INT 1Eh vector to point at their location.
          Since the "assumed" floppy parameters get moved around and INT 1Eh
          gets updated to point to their new location, this may cause the
          contents of the floppy params to get trashed, if they weren't
          actually copied to 0000h:7C00h by the bootstrap loader (that is the
          boot sector or the LOADER utility).

Format of diskette parameter table:
Offset  Size    Description     (Table 01264)
 00h    BYTE    first specify byte
                bits 7-4: step rate (Fh=2ms,Eh=4ms,Dh=6ms,etc.)
                bits 3-0: head unload time (0Fh = 240 ms)
 01h    BYTE    second specify byte
                bits 7-1: head load time (01h = 4 ms)
                bit    0: non-DMA mode (always 0)
                Note:   The DOS boot sector sets the head load time to 15ms,
                          however, one should retry the operation on failure
 02h    BYTE    delay until motor turned off (in clock ticks)
 03h    BYTE    bytes per sector (00h = 128, 01h = 256, 02h = 512, 03h = 1024)
 04h    BYTE    sectors per track (maximum if different for different tracks)
 05h    BYTE    length of gap between sectors (2Ah for 5.25", 1Bh for 3.5")
 06h    BYTE    data length (ignored if bytes-per-sector field nonzero)
 07h    BYTE    gap length when formatting (50h for 5.25", 6Ch for 3.5")
 08h    BYTE    format filler byte (default F6h)
 09h    BYTE    head settle time in milliseconds
 0Ah    BYTE    motor start time in 1/8 seconds
---IBM SurePath BIOS---
 0Bh    BYTE    maximum track number
 0Ch    BYTE    data transfer rate
 0Dh    BYTE    drive type in CMOS
