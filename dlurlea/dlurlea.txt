usage: DLURLEA.CMD

It will search the %HOME%\Mozilla subdirs for downloads.rdf and
attach an .URL/.SUBJECT EA to all files that still exist in
the download directory containing the URL it was donwloaded from.

Warning: This may include passwords or other sensitive informations.

Cou can retrieve the stored URL using
 - FileCommander/2 -- press F11 on the file
 - WPS -- look at the first/second 'file' page in the file notebook
 - CMD -- 'type -ea:FILENAME'
 - my Typ(2) program

Maybe you want to put an icon for the program near Mozilla.
Since the download.rdf file is keept current, even when Mozilla
runs, you can run this program as often as you wish.
Since this program parses all lines and tries to look for
the downloaded files, you may want to cleanup the file from
time to time..

Limitation: 
 * has only unicode to codepage support for codepages 
   437 and 850 -- ask if you need more.
   
 * may not find, or find only slowly your profile directory, 
   set mozilla_home or edit the rexx code to change this.
   (should be fine now, usingg OS2.INI values)
   
 * processin large downloads.rdf files may takes a long time,
   also an download directory with many files/subdirectories
   will cause slowdown. dlurlea may display "cleanup recommended"
   messages. Use the Mozilla Download manager (Extra/ menu item)
   and remove successfully downloaded files, ore simply delete
   downloads.rdf in your profile directory.
 
   
   
CBOOK.CMD   
=========

  Removes some tags, so that the Mozilla bookmarks.html is
  more human readable. Removes duplicate lines if they are in the
  same subfolder.
  
  Usage: 
    1) use the Mozilla Bookmark option to recursivly sort the bookmarks.
    2) exit Mozilla
    3) use cbook.cmd (full path\)bookmarks.html
    
  If you intend to publish your bookmarks.html file, you need to do
  some more changes: declare charset, convert &->&amp; complete
  HTML markup...
 
    
WALLET.CMD
========== 

  Decodes login names/passwords from Mozilla profile directory.
  It can only decode base64 fields, not password encrypted fields.
  
  Usage:
    go to the ????????.slt Profile subdirectory and run wallet.cmd
    or use wallet.cmd filename_with_full_path.
    
  The interestingg files are named like 53706525.s and 53710994.w.
  Since walletc.cmd produces much output without any delay, you
  likely will use "wallet.cmd | more" or "wallet.cmd > logfile.txt".
    


Changes
=======

 נ 2004.12.06
 ‏ Using 'Use Arg Application' was not an good idea, since
   only Object Rexx dialect seem to support this.
 ‏ try to do more brute-force search when %home%\Mozilla does 
   not contain downloads.rdf files 
   (%mozilla_home%, %home%, %programs%).
   
 נ 2005.07.03
 ‏ improved way to find downloads.rdf
 ‏ improved user interface
 ‏ added wallet.cmd form/password decoder
